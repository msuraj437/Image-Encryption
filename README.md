# Image-Encryption
Chaotic logistic mapping is a type of chaotic map that can be used for image encryption. It is widely used in image encryption systems due to its intrinsic advantages such as extreme sensitivity to initial values, ergodicity and pseudo-randomness

The Logistic Map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often referred to as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behavior can arise from very simple nonlinear dynamical equations. It is a one-dimensional discrete-time map that exhibits an unexpected degree of complexity. Historically it has been one of the most important and paradigmatic systems during the early days of research on deterministic chaos.
